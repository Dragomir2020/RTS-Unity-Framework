# RTS-Unity-Framework
Basic setup to link players in unity
## Features
- Syncs transform
- Initializes camera on player for a first person view
- Only creates camera and audio object for local player
- Gives each player authority over their player object
- Tested on multiple build platforms and communicating through NAT.
## TODO
- In the future I will use this to link player movement in a multiplayer game or VR chat room
- I need to get better understanding of NetworkAnimator, so animations can by linked over the network also.
